#How to use

To take a look around first install XAMPP (http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html)
in your favourite OS. Download or clone the project files from github. Open a browser 
and type "http://localhost/phpmyadmin/", then go to "Import" and upload the project's 
database. Put the rest of the files to the "htdocs" directory of xampp. Again type
"http://localhost/COOS-master/Source%20Code/" or the directory you put the files and...
the application is up 'n' runnin'! The only problem exists in texts where nearly 
everything is in greek.
